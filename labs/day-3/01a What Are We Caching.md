## **...What Are We Caching...?**

We're caching **Maven dependencies** - specifically, all the `.jar` (Java Archive) files that your project needs to compile and run.

**But we can cache anything for any workflow, as long as it's stored inside your project directory and is is time-consuming to download or generate every time. Instead of downloading/building it every time, we save it after the first successful run and reuse it in subsequent runs.**

### **The Problem Without Caching**

When you build a Java/Maven project, your code depends on external libraries. For example, even the simple quickstart project depends on:
- JUnit (for testing)
- Various Maven plugins
- Their transitive dependencies (libraries that *those* libraries need)

Here's what happens in **every pipeline run WITHOUT caching**:

```
Pipeline Run #1:
1. GitLab starts a fresh, empty Docker container
2. Maven checks pom.xml and sees: "I need JUnit 4.11"
3. Maven downloads JUnit from Maven Central (internet): https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/.../junit-4.11.jar
4. Maven sees JUnit needs Hamcrest, downloads that too
5. Maven downloads 50+ other .jar files (plugins, etc.)
6. Total download: ~15-30 MB over 100+ HTTP requests
7. Time: 2-3 minutes

Pipeline Run #2 (same code, just re-running):
1. GitLab starts a NEW fresh, empty Docker container
2. Maven downloads EVERYTHING again (same 50+ files)
3. Time: 2-3 minutes again 😢
```

### **The Solution: Caching**

With caching, we **save** all those downloaded `.jar` files after the first successful build:

```
Pipeline Run #1 (with cache config):
1. Fresh Docker container starts
2. GitLab checks: "Do I have a cache?" → No
3. Maven downloads all dependencies (2-3 minutes)
4. BUILD SUCCESS
5. GitLab compresses .m2/repository folder → cache.zip (5-10 MB)
6. GitLab uploads cache.zip to its storage

Pipeline Run #2:
1. Fresh Docker container starts  
2. GitLab checks: "Do I have a cache?" → Yes! (cache.zip exists)
3. GitLab downloads cache.zip (5 seconds)
4. GitLab extracts cache.zip to .m2/repository
5. Maven looks for dependencies → finds them all locally!
6. No internet downloads needed
7. Time: 20-30 seconds 🎉
```

## **What's Actually in the Cache?**

The cache contains the `.m2/repository` directory, which looks like this:

```
.m2/repository/
├── junit/
│   └── junit/
│       └── 4.11/
│           ├── junit-4.11.jar          ← The actual library
│           ├── junit-4.11.pom          ← Metadata
│           └── junit-4.11.jar.sha1     ← Checksum
├── org/
│   └── apache/
│       └── maven/
│           └── plugins/
│               └── maven-compiler-plugin/
│                   └── 3.8.0/
│                       └── maven-compiler-plugin-3.8.0.jar
└── [hundreds of other libraries...]
```

Each `.jar` file is a **compiled Java library** - pre-written code that your project uses.

## **Why the `MAVEN_OPTS` Variable?**

This is the **critical trick**:

```yaml
variables:
  MAVEN_OPTS: "-Dmaven.repo.local=.m2/repository"
```

**Without this:** Maven saves dependencies to `~/.m2/repository` (in the container's home directory, outside your project folder)

**With this:** Maven saves dependencies to `.m2/repository` (inside your project folder)

**Why it matters:** GitLab can only cache things **inside your project directory**. So we redirect Maven to save inside the project, then tell GitLab to cache that folder.

## **The Smart Cache Key**

```yaml
cache:
  key:
    files:
      - pom.xml
```

This creates a cache key based on the **content** of `pom.xml`. 

**Example:**
- Your `pom.xml` has JUnit 4.11 → Cache key: `abc123xyz`
- You change to JUnit 5.0 in `pom.xml` → Cache key changes to: `def456uvw`
- GitLab sees new key, downloads new dependencies, creates new cache
- Old cache with JUnit 4.11 is ignored/eventually deleted

**If you just changed a `.java` file:**
- `pom.xml` unchanged → Cache key still `abc123xyz`
- GitLab reuses existing cache → Fast build!

## **Visual Summary**

```
WITHOUT CACHE:
Internet → [Download 50 JARs] → Pipeline Container → Build → ✓
Time: 2-3 minutes per run

WITH CACHE (first run):
Internet → [Download 50 JARs] → Pipeline Container → Build → ✓
                                       ↓
                                [Save cache.zip] → GitLab Storage

WITH CACHE (subsequent runs):
GitLab Storage → [Download cache.zip] → Pipeline Container → Build → ✓
Time: 20-30 seconds per run
```

## **The Key Benefit**

Instead of downloading 50+ individual files over slow HTTP connections every time, you download **one compressed archive** once, which is:
- Faster (single download vs. 50+ downloads)
- Smaller (compressed)
- More reliable (fewer network requests = fewer chances to fail)
