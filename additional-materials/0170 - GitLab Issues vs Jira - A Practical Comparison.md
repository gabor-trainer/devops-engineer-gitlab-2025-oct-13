- Markdown support for descriptions
- Quick actions (slash commands)
- Linked to commits, branches, MRs automatically

**Example: Creating an issue**
```markdown
## Description
User login is failing on Safari browsers

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Safari browser
2. Navigate to /login
3. Enter credentials
4. Click "Sign In"

## Expected Behavior
User should be redirected to dashboard

## Actual Behavior
Login form reloads with no error message

/label ~bug ~priority::high
/milestone %"Sprint 23"
/assign @john
```

**Quick actions available:**
```
/assign @user          - Assign issue
/label ~bug           - Add label
/milestone %sprint    - Set milestone
/due 2025-12-31       - Set due date
/estimate 2h          - Time estimate
/weight 3             - Set weight (story points)
/close                - Close issue
```

---

#### Jira Issues

**Strengths:**
- Rich custom field types (cascading selects, multi-select, etc.)
- Issue linking types (blocks, relates to, duplicates)
- Sub-tasks and epic hierarchies
- Advanced search (JQL - Jira Query Language)

  AND assignee = currentUser() 
  AND priority in (High, Highest)
  ORDER BY updated DESC
```

---

### 2. Workflow & Status Management

#### GitLab Issues

**Available workflows:**
- **Basic:** Open → Closed
- **With labels:** Open → In Progress → In Review → Closed
- **Board-based:** Drag and drop between lists

**Configuration:**
```
Issue Boards:
├─ Open
├─ To Do (~workflow::todo)
├─ Doing (~workflow::doing)
├─ Review (~workflow::review)
├─ Done (~workflow::done)
└─ Closed
```

**Limitations:**
- No custom workflows beyond labels
- No approval gates or transitions
- Limited automation rules

**Example: Label-based workflow**
```markdown
# Labels define the workflow
~workflow::todo
~workflow::doing
~workflow::review
~workflow::done

# Move issue by adding/removing labels
/unlabel ~workflow::todo
/label ~workflow::doing
```

---

#### Jira Workflows

**Advanced capabilities:**
- Custom workflow states
- Transition rules and validators
- Required fields per transition
- Post-functions (automation)
- Screen customization per state

**Example: Custom workflow**
```
[Open] → [In Progress] → [Code Review] → [Testing] → [Done]
   ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓
[Blocked]  [On Hold]      [Failed]      [Rejected]
```

**Transition Rules:**
```
Transition: Open → In Progress
├─ Validator: Assignee must be set
├─ Validator: Estimate must be provided
├─ Post-function: Set "Started Date" to current time
└─ Post-function: Send notification to team lead

Transition: Code Review → Testing
├─ Validator: PR link must be provided

1. **You're already using GitLab for SCM**
   - No additional tools to learn
   - Single sign-on, single interface
   - Unified search across code and issues

2. **You want tight code integration**
   - Auto-close issues from commits
   - Branch creation from issues
   - MR ↔ Issue linking automatic

3. **You prefer simplicity**
   - Minimal configuration needed
   - Straightforward workflow
   - Lower learning curve

4. **You're a small to medium team**
   - Less than 50 developers
   - Simple workflow needs
   - Cost-conscious

5. **You prioritize DevOps workflow**
   - Issues → Code → Pipeline → Deploy
   - Value stream visibility
   - Developer-centric features

---

## When to Choose Jira

### ✅ Choose Jira if:

1. **You need complex workflows**
   - Multi-stage approval processes
   - Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
   - Custom issue types and fields

2. **You require advanced reporting**
   - Executive dashboards
   - Custom analytics
   - Time tracking and billing

3. **You're a large enterprise**
   - 100+ developers
   - Multiple teams/departments
   - Complex project structures

4. **You need extensive customization**
   - Custom fields and issue types
   - Complex automation rules
   - Third-party plugin ecosystem

5. **You have non-technical stakeholders**
   - Product managers
   - Business analysts
   - Customer support teams
   - (They don't need GitLab access)

---

## Hybrid Approach: Using Both

Many organizations use **both** tools together:

```
GitLab Issues:
├─ Technical tasks
├─ Bugs found in code review
├─ Technical debt tracking
└─ Developer-focused work

Jira:
├─ User stories and epics
├─ Product backlog management
├─ Sprint planning
└─ Cross-team coordination
```

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Product Manager creates user story in Jira
   → WEBAPP-456: "User profile management"

2. Developer breaks it down in GitLab:
   → Issue #789: "Create profile API endpoint"
   → Issue #790: "Build profile UI component"
   → Issue #791: "Add profile tests"

3. GitLab issues link to Jira:
   → Commit message: "WEBAPP-456 #789 Implement profile API"

4. Updates flow back to Jira:
   → Jira issue shows GitLab commits and MRs
```

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
notify-jira:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
  after_script:
    - |
      curl -X POST "https://jira.company.com/rest/api/2/issue/WEBAPP-456/comment" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{
          "body": "Deployed to production by GitLab pipeline '${CI_PIPELINE_ID}'"
        }'
```

## Migration Considerations

### Migrating from Jira to GitLab

**What transfers well:**
- ✅ Issue titles and descriptions
- ✅ Comments and attachments
- ✅ Basic metadata (status, assignee, labels)
- ⚠️ Custom fields (manual mapping required)
- ⚠️ Workflows (need redesign)
- ❌ Time tracking details (complex)

**Migration tools:**
```
GitLab Import Options:
├─ Jira import (built-in)
│   └─ Maps Jira issues to GitLab issues
│
└─ API-based migration
    └─ Custom script for complex mappings
```

**Example: Using GitLab's Jira importer**
```
1. GitLab: Project → Settings → Import → Jira
2. Enter Jira credentials
3. Select project to import
4. Map Jira statuses to GitLab labels
5. Import issues (preserves comments, attachments)
```

**Challenges:**
- Complex workflows don't translate
- Custom fields need manual recreation
- Advanced automations need rebuilding
- Reports and dashboards don't migrate

---

### Migrating from GitLab to Jira

**What transfers well:**
- ✅ Issue descriptions
- ✅ Comments
- ✅ Attachments
- ⚠️ Links to code (become external links)
- ❌ Native GitLab integrations

**Migration approach:**
```python
# Example migration script
import requests

gitlab_issues = get_gitlab_issues(project_id)

for issue in gitlab_issues:
    jira_issue = {
        "fields": {
            "project": {"key": "WEBAPP"},
            "summary": issue['title'],
            "description": issue['description'],
            "issuetype": {"name": "Task"},
            "labels": issue['labels']
        }
    }
