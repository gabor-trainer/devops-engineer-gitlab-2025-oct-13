### **Understanding CI/CD Stages**

#### **The point: `stages` organizes your pipeline into sequential phases.**

**Key points:**

1. **Sequential execution** - Stages run one after another (build → test → deploy)
2. **Parallel jobs within stages** - All jobs in the same stage run at the same time
3. **Automatic stopping** - If any job in a stage fails, the next stages won't run

**Example:**
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# All these jobs run at the same time
test-unit:
  stage: test
  
test-integration:
  stage: test
  
test-e2e:
  stage: test
```

**Example:** Build everything first, then run all tests in parallel, then deploy only if tests pass. It's the backbone structure of your pipeline workflow.


#### **1. The Principle: An Assembly Line for Your Code**

Imagine building a car on an assembly line. You have distinct phases: build the chassis, install the engine, paint the body, and perform a quality inspection. You would never perform the quality inspection *before* the chassis is built. Each phase must happen in a specific, logical order.

In GitLab CI/CD, **`stages` are the high-level, ordered phases of your software assembly line.** They are the backbone of your pipeline, defining the sequence of operations from start to finish.

The **`jobs`** you create are the specific tasks or automated machines that operate *within* each stage. For example, the `test` stage might have several jobs running in parallel: `unit-tests`, `integration-tests`, and `code-style-check`.

> **The Golden Rule of Stages:** All jobs in one stage must complete successfully before **any** jobs in the next stage can begin. This is the fundamental principle that makes stages so powerful.

#### **2. The `stages` Keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

You define the order of your pipeline at the top level of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file using the `stages` keyword. This creates a global sequence for the entire pipeline.

**Example:**
```yaml
# filename: .gitlab-ci.yml

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

*   **Syntax:** `stages` is a root-level keyword that takes a list of strings.
*   **Order is Critical:** The order in which you list the stages is the exact order in which they will execute. In the example above, `build` will always run before `test`, and `test` will always run before `deploy`.

**What if you don't define `stages`?**
If the `stages` keyword is omitted, GitLab will use a default set of stages:
`.pre`, `build`, `test`, `deploy`, `.post`. This is useful for simple pipelines but it is a best practice to always explicitly define your stages for clarity.

#### **3. Attributes: A Clarification (Stages vs. Jobs)**

This is a critical point of clarification: **Stages themselves do not have attributes in the YAML file.**

You cannot assign a `script`, `image`, or `rules` block to a stage. A stage is simply a named step in the sequence.

The **jobs** are what have the attributes. The most important attribute of a job is the `stage` keyword, which **assigns the job to a stage**.

| Job Name            | Job Attribute   | Belongs to Stage |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| `build-app`         | `stage: build`  | `build`          |
| `run-unit-tests`    | `stage: test`   | `test`           |
| `deploy-to-staging` | `stage: deploy` | `deploy`         |

If a job does not have a `stage` keyword, it is automatically assigned to the `test` stage by default.

#### **4. The Core Benefits of Using Stages**

Properly defined stages provide several key architectural benefits:

1.  **Logical Workflow & Order of Operations:** Stages enforce a predictable and logical flow. This ensures that you never deploy code that hasn't been tested, or test code that hasn't been successfully built.

2.  **Automated Quality Gates:** A stage acts as a powerful, automated quality gate. If any job within a stage fails (e.g., a single unit test fails in the `test` stage), the entire stage is considered failed. The pipeline stops immediately, and subsequent stages (like `deploy`) will be skipped. This prevents a failure from moving downstream and impacting production.

3.  **Parallelism and Efficiency:** While stages themselves run sequentially, all jobs *within* a single stage run **in parallel** (assuming enough runners are available). This allows you to run multiple independent tests or build multiple application components simultaneously, dramatically reducing the total time your pipeline takes to complete.

4.  **Visualization and Readability:** The pipeline graph you see in the GitLab UI is a direct visual representation of your `stages` block. The columns in the graph are your stages, and the bubbles within them are your jobs. This makes the entire workflow instantly understandable to anyone on the team, from developers to project managers.

#### **5. Advanced Concept: Overriding Stage Order with `needs`**

While the strict sequential order of stages is a powerful default, modern pipelines sometimes require more flexibility. What if a fast job in a later stage doesn't actually depend on a slow job in an earlier stage?

For example, a `lint-code` job in the `test` stage only needs the source code; it does not need to wait for the `build-app` job to finish compiling.

The **`needs`** keyword allows you to create a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of dependencies between jobs, effectively overriding the stage order for specific jobs.

**Example without `needs` (Traditional):**
The `lint-job` must wait for `build-job` to finish, even though it doesn't need its output.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - sleep 60 # Simulates a long build

lint-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Linting code..."
```
*Result: `lint-job` starts after 60 seconds.*

**Example with `needs` (Modern DAG):**
The `lint-job` starts immediately, in parallel with `build-job`.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - sleep 60

lint-job:
  stage: test
  needs: [] # An empty 'needs' array means it has no dependencies and can start immediately
  script:
    - echo "Linting code..."
```
*Result: `lint-job` starts immediately.*

By using `needs`, you can create highly optimized pipelines where jobs run as soon as their specific dependencies are met, rather than waiting for an entire stage to complete.

**Conclusion:** Stages are the foundational organizing principle of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. They provide structure, enforce quality, and enable parallelism. While the default sequential execution is a powerful and safe starting point, advanced features like `needs` allow you to build highly efficient and complex workflows tailored to your project's specific dependencies.
